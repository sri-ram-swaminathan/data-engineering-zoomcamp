### Question 1. Bruin Pipeline Structure

In a Bruin project, what are the required files/directories?

>- `.bruin.yml` and `pipeline/` with `pipeline.yml` and `assets/`

---

### Question 2. Materialization Strategies

You're building a pipeline that processes NYC taxi data organized by month based on `pickup_datetime`. Which incremental strategy is best for processing a specific interval period by deleting and inserting data for that time period?

>- `time_interval` - incremental based on a time column

---

### Question 3. Pipeline Variables

You have the following variable defined in `pipeline.yml`:

```yaml
variables:
  taxi_types:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    default: ["yellow", "green"]
```

How do you override this when running the pipeline to only process yellow taxis?


>- `bruin run --var 'taxi_types=["yellow"]'`

---

### Question 4. Running with Dependencies

You've modified the `ingestion/trips.py` asset and want to run it plus all downstream assets. Which command should you use?

>- `bruin run ingestion/trips.py --downstream`

---

### Question 5. Quality Checks

You want to ensure the `pickup_datetime` column in your trips table never has NULL values. Which quality check should you add to your asset definition?


>- `name: not_null`


---

### Question 6. Lineage and Dependencies

After building your pipeline, you want to visualize the dependency graph between assets. Which Bruin command should you use?

>- `bruin lineage`

---

### Question 7. First-Time Run

You're running a Bruin pipeline for the first time on a new DuckDB database. What flag should you use to ensure tables are created from scratch?

>- `--full-refresh`
